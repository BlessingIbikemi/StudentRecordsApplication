# StudentsRecord

The solution contains four projects which are the Api project, the Mvc project, the test project and the service project.
The service project contains the applicationDbcontext class, the models and the database operations. 
For the database, I used the Inmemorydatabase to make testing easy. 
The Microsoft Entity Framework was used as the ORM.
