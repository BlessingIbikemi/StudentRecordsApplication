# StudentsRecord

The solution contains four projects which are the Api project, the Mvc project, the test project and the Repository project.
The Repository project contains the applicationDbcontext class, the models and the database operations. 
For the database, I used the Inmemorydatabase to make testing easy. 
The Microsoft Entity Framework was used as the ORM.
A test was carried out on each database operations and Xunit was used.
The API contains five endpoints and swagger was used for documentation.
